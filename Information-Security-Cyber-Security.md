# Cybersecurity.

### 1. What is Information security?

**Information security**, also known as **cyber security,** is the practice of protecting sensitive information, *including hard data and digital data, from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.*

### 2. What is Cyber security?

**Cybersecurity** is a branch of **information security** that focuses on the protection of *electronic information and system that are stored, processed, or transmitted electronically.* This includes protecting computer systems, networks, and data.
	
### 3. What is Hacking?
**Hacking** refers to the unauthorized access, modification, or destruction of information or systems.

### 4.  What is Ethical Hacking?

**Ethical hacking,** also known as **"white hat" hacking,** is the practice of legally and ethically accessing and testing computer systems and networks to identify vulnerabilities.

### 5. What are Vulnerabilities?

A **Vulnerability** is a *weakness* in a system or network that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.

### 6. What is Exploit?

An **Exploit** is a method or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability in a system or network. Once a vulnerability has been discovered, an attacker can develop an exploit to take advantage of it and gain unauthorized access to a system or perform other malicious actions. Exploits can take many forms such as software programs, scripts, or commands.

### 7. What is Payload?

A **payload** is the portion of malware or exploit that carries out the malicious action. It is typically a piece of code or data that is delivered through the exploit and executed on the target system. The payload can take many forms, such as a script, software program, or command, and it can be used to perform a variety of *malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive information, installing backdoors, or disrupting system operations.*

### 8. What is Vulnerability Research?

**Vulnerability research** is the process of *identifying and analyzing security weaknesses in software and systems* and taking steps to mitigate them. Techniques used in vulnerability research include code review, static and dynamic analysis, and penetration testing. The ultimate goal is to report vulnerabilities to the vendor or developer of the affected software or system so that they can be fixed.
	
### 9. What is a Vulnerability assessment?

The goal of **Vulnerability assessment** is to identify potential security weaknesses and provide a prioritized list of vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.
		
### 10. What is Penetration testing?

**Penetration testing,** also known as **"pen testing"** or **"ethical hacking,"** is the process of legally and ethically simulating an attack on a computer system, network, or web application to *identify vulnerabilities and assess the security of the system.* The goal of penetration testing is to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker and to evaluate the effectiveness of the current security controls in place.
		
### 11. What are the different types of penetration testing?
	
*There are three types of penetration testing* **Black Box Testing, Gray Box Testing,** or **White Box Testing...**

**1. Black Box Testing:-** In this type of testing, the tester has no prior knowledge of the system and simulates an attack from the outside. This simulates a real-world scenario where an attacker does not have any knowledge about the system.

**2. Gray Box Testing:-** In this type of testing, the tester has some prior knowledge of the system, simulating an attack from an insider or someone who has already gained access to the system.

**3. White Box Testing:-** In this type of testing, the tester has complete knowledge of the system and simulates an attack from the inside. This type of testing is used to identify vulnerabilities that are not exposed to external attackers. 
		
### 12. Which of the approaches are used in penetration testing?

**1. Reconnaissance(Footprinting):-** Gather information about the target system, such as IP addresses, open ports, and software versions.

-	*There are two main types of reconnaissance:*

	-   **Passive:-** Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target system. This can be done through publicly available sources, such as websites and search engines.


	-   **Active:-** Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target system. This can include techniques such as network scans and vulnerability scans and can raise the risk of detection.

**2. Scanning:-** Use tools to scan the target system for vulnerabilities and open ports and Banner Grabbing.
		
**3. Gaining Access:-** Attempt to gain access to the target system through various means such as network, OS, or application vulnerabilities. This may also include escalating privileges to gain higher access.
		
**4. Reporting:-** Document the findings and recommend remediation steps.

### 13. What are the different phases or steps involved in the hacking process?

**1. Reconnaissance:-** Gather information about the target system, such as IP addresses, open ports, and software versions. This can be done through passive or active means.

**2. Scanning:-** Use tools to scan the target system for vulnerabilities and open ports, and perform banner grabbing.

**3. Gaining Access:-** Attempt to gain access to the target system through various means such as network, OS, or application vulnerabilities. This may also include escalating privileges to gain higher access.

**4. Maintaining Access:-** Once access is gained, maintain access by injecting backdoors and trojans, using the system as a launchpad, sniffing/monitoring the network, and using resources.

**5. Clearing Tracks:-** Cover up any traces of the hacking activity by destroying proof and hiding any tools or files used during the hack.

**6. Reporting:-** Document the findings and recommend remediation steps to improve the security of the target system.

### 14. What are security threats and their types?
	
*Security threats refer to malicious activities or events that pose a risk to an organization's information systems and data. There are various types of security threats, including:*

**1. Network Attacks.**

-	*Network attacks refer to various malicious activities aimed at disrupting the normal functioning of a computer network. They can range from unauthorized access to data theft, destruction of data, or disruption of services.* 
					
	-	**Spoofing:-** Spoofing attacks involve forging the source address of a network packet to trick the target into thinking the packet is coming from a trusted source.
						
	-	**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):-** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks involve intercepting and modifying communication between two parties without their knowledge.

	-	**Sniffing:-** Sniffing is the process of capturing and analyzing network traffic for sensitive information.

	-	**Arp poisoning:-** ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning is a type of attack in which an attacker manipulates ARP cache entries on a network to redirect traffic to their device.

	-	**Phishing:-** Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that involves tricking the user into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, by posing as a trustworthy entity.
					
	-	**Dos/DDos:-** DoS (Denial of Service) and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks involve overwhelming a server or network with excessive traffic, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.

**2. Host/Node Attacks.**
			
-	*These attacks target a specific device or computer on a network, such as a server or desktop.*

	-	**OS Attack:-** An OS (Operating System) attack targets vulnerabilities in the software that runs a device or computer.

	-	**Malware Attack:-** Malware refers to malicious software, such as viruses, trojans, and spyware, that can compromise the security of a device or computer.

	-	**Password Attack:-** This type of attack involves attempting to guess or crack a password to gain unauthorized access to an account or system.

	-	**Privilege Escalation:-** This type of attack involves exploiting a vulnerability in a system to gain higher-level privileges than are normally allowed for a user.

	-	**Application Attack:-** This type of attack targets vulnerabilities in applications, such as web applications, to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or disrupt the functionality of the application.

	-	**Physical Attack:-** This type of attack involves physically accessing a device or computer to steal or damage data.

	-	**Configuration Attack:-** This type of attack involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the configuration of a device, computer, or system to gain unauthorized access or disrupt its functionality.

	-	**Insufficient training:-** Lack of proper training for employees on how to handle and protect server resources, which can lead to accidental damage or loss of data.

### 15. What is the CIA Triad?

The CIA triad is a model for information security that consists of three components: 
**Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.**
		
-	**Confidentiality** means that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access and is only available to authorized individuals.

-	**Integrity** ensures that the data remains unaltered and uncorrupted and that it is not subject to unauthorized modifications during transmission.

-	**Availability** refers to the ability of authorized users to access the information they need when they need it. This includes ensuring that systems, networks, and data are reliable, and that data can be recovered in the event of a disaster.
	
### 16. What is the Defense in Depth?

**Defense in depth** is a security strategy that involves implementing multiple layers of protection around a system or network to prevent, detect, and respond to security threats. The idea behind the defense in depth is that if one layer of security fails, there are multiple additional layers to prevent unauthorized access and minimize damage. This approach helps to create a strong, comprehensive security program that reduces the risk of security breaches and protects against a wide range of threats. Examples of different layers of defense in depth include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, access control systems, and security monitoring tools.

		
### 17. What is Vulnerability management?

**Vulnerability management** is the process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in an organization's information systems and data. The goal of vulnerability management is to reduce the risk of successful attacks by identifying and mitigating potential security weaknesses.
	
### 18. What is the difference between Red Team, Blue Team, and Purple Team?

**Red Team:-** A red team is a group of security experts who simulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures of real-world attackers to test an organization's security defenses and identify weaknesses. The goal of a red team is to identify security gaps before attackers do and help organizations improve their overall security posture.

**Blue Team:-** A blue team is a group of security professionals who are responsible for defending an organization against cyber threats. The blue team is focused on detecting, responding to, and mitigating security incidents. They are the first line of defense in an organization's security strategy.

**Purple Team:-** A purple team is a combination of red and blue teams that work together to identify and mitigate security risks. The purple team is responsible for both simulating attacks and detecting and responding to security incidents. The goal of a purple team is to improve the overall security posture of an organization by combining the strengths of both red and blue teams.
